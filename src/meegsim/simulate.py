    This class can be used to create configurations of sources
    of activity (e.g., narrowband oscillation or 1/f noise).

    Attributes
    ----------
    src : mne.SourceSpaces
        The source space that contains all candidate source locations.
    snr_mode : {'global', 'local'}
        The desired mode for the adjustment of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

        .. note::

          * If ``'global'`` (default), the total power of **all** point/patch sources is
            adjusted relative to the total power of **all** noise sources. The target
            value of SNR should be provided in the ``snr_global`` argument of
            :meth:`~meegsim.simulate.SourceSimulator.simulate`. The spatial distribution
            of source activity can be controlled using the ``std`` argument when adding
            sources.

          * If ``'local'``, the power of **each** point/patch source is adjusted relative
            to the total power of **all** noise sources. The target value(s) of SNR
            should be provided in the ``snr`` argument when adding sources to the
            simulation via either
            :meth:`~meegsim.simulate.SourceSimulator.add_point_sources` or
            :meth:`~meegsim.simulate.SourceSimulator.add_patch_sources`
    base_std : float, optional
        The source activity is scaled by the base standard deviation before
        projecting to sensor space. By default, it is equal to :math:`10^{-9}`,
        corresponding to the dipolar moment of 1 nAm.

        location : list or callable

        waveform : array or callable
            Waveforms of source activity provided either directly in an array (fixed
            for every configuration) or as a function that generates the waveforms
            (but differ between configurations if the generation is random).
        snr : None, float, or array, optional
            SNR values for the defined sources, only used if ``snr_mode`` is set to
            ``'local'``. Can be None (no adjustment of SNR), a single value
            that is used for all sources or an array with one SNR
            value per source.
        std : float, array, or SourceEstimate, optional
            Desired standard deviation of the source activity, provided via one of
            the following options:

            - a single value that applies to all sources
            - an array with one value per source
            - a :class:`~mne.SourceEstimate` object that contains values of all
              vertices of the source space. In this case, the value will be adjusted
              for each source automatically based on its location.

            This parameter can be used in combination with the global SNR
            mode to set an arbitrary spatial distribution of source activity.
            By default, 1 is used so the variance of all sources is the same.
            If the value of ``snr`` is specified, this parameter will effectively
            be ignored.
        location_params : dict, optional
            Keyword arguments that will be passed to ``location``
            if a function is provided.

        extents : None (default), float, or list
            Extents (radius, in mm) of each patch. If None (default), location must

            grown (using :func:`mne.grow_labels`) from vertices specified in
            location according to the provided values of extent. If a single number
            is provided, all patch sources have the same extent.
        subject : str, optional
            Subject name, only used when growing patch sources from the central vertex.

        subject_dir : str, optional

        coupling : tuple or dict

            ``v`` are the names of sources that should be coupled. Both

            If used, the dictionary should contain tuples ``(u, v)`` as keys,

            of the coupling method. Use this dictionary to define coupling
            parameters that are specific for a given edge. Such definitions will

        Notes
        -----
        For the information on required coupling parameters, please refer to the
        :doc:`documentation </api/coupling>` of the corresponding coupling method(s).

        Examples
        --------
        Adding a single connectivity edge:

        >>> from meegsim.coupling import ppc_von_mises
        ...
        ... sim.set_coupling(('s1', 's2'), method=ppc_von_mises,
        ...                  kappa=1, phase_lag=0, fmin=8, fmax=12)

        Adding multiple connectivity edges at once:

        >>> from meegsim.coupling import ppc_von_mises
        ...
        ... sim.set_coupling(coupling={
        ...     ('s1', 's2'): dict(kappa=1, phase_lag=np.pi/3, fmin=10),
        ...     ('s2', 's3'): dict(kappa=0.5, phase_lag=-np.pi/6)
        ... }, method=ppc_von_mises, fmin=8, fmax=12)

        In the example above, ``method`` and ``fmax`` values apply to both
        coupling edges, while ``kappa`` and ``phase_lag`` are edge-specific.
        ``fmin`` is defined as a common parameter but also has a different
        value for the edge ``('s1', 's2')``. Therefore, it will be set to `6`
        for the edge ``('s1', 's2')`` and to `8` for the edge ``('s2', 's3')``.
