    Generate a list of walkaround paths in a tree starting from start_node.

    Walkaround paths are pairs of nodes where each pair represents an edge
    in the tree, starting from the specified start_node.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    tree : networkx.Graph
        The tree in which to generate walkaround paths.
    start_node : int
        The node from which to start generating paths.
        If start_node is None (default), the start node will be drawn randomly.
    random_state : int or None, optional
        Seed for the random number generator. If start_node is None (default), the
        start node will be drawn randomly, and results will vary between function calls.

    out : list of tuples
        A list of pairs of nodes representing walkaround paths.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coupling_graph : nx.Graph
        The coupling graph that describes the desired connectivity patterns.
        All edges should have the coupling parameters as attributes.
    random_state : int or None, optional
